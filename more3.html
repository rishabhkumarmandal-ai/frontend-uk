            Trisul is a group of three Himalayan mountain peaks of western Kumaun, with the highest (Trisul I) reaching 7120m. The three peaks resemble a trident - in Hindi/Sanskrit, Trishula, trident, is the weapon of Shiva. The Trishul group forms the southeast corner of the ring of peaks enclosing the Nanda Devi Sanctuary, about 15 kilometres (9 mi) west-southwest of Nanda Devi itself. The main peak, Trisul I, was the first peak over 7,000 m (22,970 ft) to have ever been climbed, in 1907.The three peaks are named Trisul I, Trisul II, and Trisul III. The massif is a north-south ridge, with Trisul I at the north end and Trisul III at the south. The massif runs roughly North-South, and hence appears compressed when viewed from the south (Ranikhet, Kausani), and more stretched out from the Southeast (Chamoli, Bedini Bugyal).

Pandavas, according to legend, took this path on their way to heaven. Just Yudhishthira (one of the Pandavas) and a puppy made it to the afterlife. Many of the other Pandavas perished en route. According to mythology, Swargarohini is the only way to reach Heaven while still in human form. The holiest lake of Satopanth is located within the Chaukhamba massifs. Since Lord Brahma, Vishnu, and Mahesh are said to have bathed in the waters of this lake, it is revered as sacred and sweet.
